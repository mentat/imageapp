==== Using:

Add this to your app in a dir called 'imageapp' (or whatever).  You could 
do a submodule:

    git submodule add git@github.com:mentat/imageapp.git WHERE_EVER_YOU_WANT
    git submodule init

Make sure to add these two items to your app.yaml:

    - url: /static/SOME_PATH
      static_dir: WHERE_EVER_YOU_WANT/static
      secure: optional

    - url: /SOME_PATH.*
      script: WHERE_EVER_YOU_WANT/main.py

By default the app assumes WHERE_EVER_YOU_WANT and SOME_PATH are 'imageapp/' but
you can customize this by placing a file called settings.py in the root of
your GAE project and adding the variable:

IMAGE_APP_PREFIX = '/my_imageapp_location/' 

Make sure to add the trailing slash.  Also, make sure that matches the URLs in 
your app.yaml (both static, which should become /static/my_imageapp_location/ and
the main.py URL, /my_imageapp_location.* ).  Note, this variable just affects the
internal URL handling, not the directory you put the code in.  All that matters for
that is the script and static_dir lines in the app.yaml.
