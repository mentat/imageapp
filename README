==== Using:

Add this to your app in a dir called 'imageapp' (called PATH below).  You could 
do a submodule:

    git submodule add git@github.com:mentat/imageapp.git PATH
    git submodule init

Make sure to add these two items to your app.yaml:

    - url: /static/PATH
      static_dir: PATH/static
      secure: optional

    - url: /PATH.*
      script: PATH/main.py

By default the app assumes PATH is 'imageapp' but
you can customize this by placing a file called settings.py in the root of
your GAE project and adding the variable:

IMAGE_APP_PATH = 'my_imageapp_location' 

Make sure that this matches the URLs in your app.yaml which would become. 

    - url: /static/my_imageapp_location
      static_dir: my_imageapp_location/static
      secure: optional

    - url: /my_imageapp_location.*
      script: my_imageapp_location/main.py
